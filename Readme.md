## Task
The schedule of train crossings between several stations is given in the format “train number; departure station; arrival station; cost; departure time; arrival time” (it is guaranteed that there are no crossings for more than a day).

It is necessary to get the “best” options (several, if possible) of travel between all stations so that you visit each station 1 time. Requests for the best options:

1. Best Price

2. Best by time
